// VARIABLE DECLARATIONS

/* STEP 1: Declare and initialize variables
- customName for the name field
- randomize for the button
- story for the paragraph that outputs the final story
*/
var customName = document.querySelector("#customname");
var randomize = document.querySelector(".rendonmize");
var story = document.querySelector(".story");

/* STEP 3: Create the variable that contains the story string that will be modified - use var storyText to containt the following:
'It was 94 farenheit outside, so :insertx: went for a walk. When they got to :inserty:, they stared in horror for a few moments, then :insertz:. Bob saw the whole thing, but he was not surprised — :insertx: weighs 300 pounds, and it was a hot day.'
*/
var storyText =
  `It was 94 farenheit outside, so :insertx: went for a walk.
   When they got to :inserty:,
   they stared in horror for a few moments,
    then :insertz:. Bob saw the whole thing, 
    but he was not surprised — :insertx: weighs 300 pounds,
     and it was a hot day.'`;

/* STEP 4: Create three arrays, insertX, insertY, and insertZ, assigning them the following array values respectively:
Donald Trump, Jackie Chan, Santa Claus
Area 51, Death Valley, Aruba
spontaneously combusted, rapidly sublimated, evaporated instantly
*/
var insertx = ["Donald Trump", "Jackie Chan", "Santa Claus"];
var inserty = ["Area 51", "Death Valley", "Aruba"];
var insertz = [
  "spontaneously combusted",
  "rapidly sublimated",
  "evaporated instantly"
];
// FUNCTIONS

/* STEP 2: have a look at the following function - if you call this function and pass it an array, it will return one of the elements of that array randomly */
function randomValueFromArray(array) {
  return array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];
}

/* STEP 6: Review the partially complete result() function below */
function result() {
  console.log("is runing");
  // STEP 7: Create a new variable called newStory and set it to the value of storyText - we don't want to overwrite the original story!
  var newStory = storyText;
  /* STEP 8: Use the randomValueFromArray() function to generate a value for each of three new variables - xItem, yItem, and zItem
	Call up the function and for each variable, pass it the array from which to grab a random string - for example if insertW was an array of strings, I would type:
	var wItem = randomValueFromArray(insertW);*/
  var xItem = randomValueFromArray(insertx);
  var yItem = randomValueFromArray(inserty);
  var zItem = randomValueFromArray(insertz);
  console.log(xItem, yItem, zItem);
  /* STEP 9: Replace the three placeholders in the newStory string — :insertx:, :inserty:, and :insertz: — with the strings stored in xItem, yItem, and zItem. Each time, be sure to update the variable newStory (with +=). You might need to do one of the above replacements twice! */
  var regex = /:insertx:/gi;
  newStory = newStory.replace(":insertz:", zItem);
  newStory = newStory.replace(":inserty:", yItem);
  newStory = newStory.replace(regex, xItem);
  console.log(newStory);
  /* STEP 10: If the user has typed a name in the customName field, replace the name 'Bob' in the story with whatever they typed */
  if (customName.value != "") {

    newStory = newStory.replace("Bob", customName.value);

  }
  /* STEP 11: If the metric radio button has been checked, we need to convert the temperature and mass numbers in the story */
  if (document.getElementById("metric").checked) {
    // STEP 11a: Create a variable called weight and convert the 300lbs to kgs (1lb = 0.453592kg)
    var weighs = 300 * 0.453592;
    // STEP 11b: Replace the string 300 pounds with the updated weight in kg
    newStory = newStory.replace("300 pounds", weighs + "kg");
    // STEP 12a: Create a variable called temp and convert °F to °C ... the formula for conversion is °C = (°F - 32) x 5/9
    var temp = ((94 - 32) * 5) / 9;
    // STEP 12b: Replace the string '94 fahrenheit' with the updated temperature in °C
    newStory = newStory.replace("94 fahrenheit", temp + `${temp} celsius`);
  }
  /* STEP 13: Make the textContent property of the story variable (which references the paragraph) equal to newStory */
  story.textContent = newStory;
  // The following line makes the paragraph visible
  story.style.visibility = "visible";
}

// EVENT LISTENERS
/* STEP 5: Add a click event listener to the randomize variable so that when the button it represents is clicked, the result() function is run. */
randomize.addEventListener('click', result);
